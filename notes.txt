What functionality do we need in our backend?
    - The ability to subscribe to a given room's network
    - If we are subscribed to the network, then when the request is sent to the network,
    we end up passing it along
    - What do we need for this?
        - Map - maps the "room" ids to the requests that are polling
        - TBH we could also use websockets (I think)


1. TBH I think that the solution is the server sent events (SSE)
    a. this seems to be what we actually want
    b. despite this, it seems easier to handle this with long polling
        (especially because our app doesn't need to be real time)
